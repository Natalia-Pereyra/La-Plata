                        La Plata was designed and planned more than 140 years ago to be the capital of the province of <strong>Buenos Aires</strong>.
                        Located on the banks of the river that gave it its name, represents a
                        model of urban planning for the entire world. Better known as the <strong>"city of diagonals"</strong>, it assures newcomers that there
                        is no way to get lost among its streets; surprises the visitor with its geometric layout, holistic architecture and
                        European style.

                        La Plata is one of a few cities in the world which has been <strong>planned before building</strong>. The city was
                        designed from its origin with aesthetic and landscape criteria of the European Baroque Urbanism of the 17th
                        century, and based on environmental and functional foundations typical of Hygieneism of the 19th century.
                        Its rationalist layout in a grid, with <strong>diagonals and squares every 6 blocks</strong> - at the intersection of
                        avenues -,
                        responded to criteria of order, organization and balance between the built space and the green space in pursuit of an
                        equitable distribution of activities and circulation.

                    The wealth of trees in La Plata offers an infinity of unmissable postcards, which can be found in streets, avenues,
                    parks and squares.
                    <br>
                    More than a <strong>hundred species of trees</strong> can be found on sidewalks and green spaces. Especially in spring and summer, the
                    flowering reflects a wide variety of colors, shapes and perfumes; representing one of the most prominent local tourist
                    attractions. Like the <strong>Jacarand√°</strong> in the photo, which dyes the city purple every November.
                    <br>
                    The forestry heritage was so important from the beginning that when the city was designed many details were taken into
                    account, among them, planting a particular tree species in <strong>avenues and diagonals</strong> to identify them.
                    Currently in the Urban Area there are some 106 taxonomic categories
                    -species, genera, varieties- and around 80 thousand specimens; many stand out for their quantity, and others for their
                    striking aesthetic features.
